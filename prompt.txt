You are my AI coding partner. I want to build an MVP for an AI-first, hyperlocal campus marketplace called “FlashFind.”

**Goal / Concept:**
FlashFind helps students get what they need *right now* on campus. 
A user types a request in natural language, like “I need a black blazer for a presentation” or “I’m sick and need cold medicine.” 
Instead of browsing listings, our app saves the request and notifies other nearby students who might be able to help.

For the MVP, I want to keep it simple:
1. Users can sign up or log in with their school email (basic authentication).
2. They can post a “Flash Request” with a short text description.
3. All requests are stored in a database and shown on a feed page.
4. Each request displays who posted it (name or username) and when.
5. (Optional) We’ll add AI parsing later to detect item type and urgency.

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js (React)
- Backend & Database: Firebase (Firestore + Auth)
- AI (later): OpenAI API
- Deployment: Vercel

---

**Core Tasks for You:**
1. Scaffold a basic Next.js app with TypeScript support.
2. Integrate Firebase (Firestore + Auth).
   - Authentication with school email only (example: must contain “.edu”).
3. Create the following pages/components:
   - `/signup` and `/login`
   - `/new-request` — a form with a text box to post a Flash Request.
   - `/feed` — displays all requests from Firestore (newest first).
4. Each request should show:
   - The request text
   - The user’s name (or email prefix)
   - Timestamp (e.g., “5 minutes ago”)
5. Add simple styling (TailwindCSS preferred).
6. Include clear comments and instructions so I can understand and modify it later.
7. Add placeholder function for future AI integration, e.g.:
   ```js
   async function parseFlashRequest(text) {
     // TODO: Use OpenAI API to parse intent, item, urgency
   }
